#Indonesian Interactive SVG Map

 One of the websites that I made uses HTML accompanied by several lines of CSS code to beautify the website, in which there is a map of Indonesia which can be clicked to 
 produce sound and can provide a description of the area, the map on this website uses SVG so that the map image when zoomed in is not broken and there are several animations 
 when scrolling is directed at the map. I created this website just to fulfill my college assignment. Please develop this project as well as possible because this project is an 
 open source project that you can edit or recode as you like. Don't forget to include my name on the source you use for the license. NOT FOR SALE
